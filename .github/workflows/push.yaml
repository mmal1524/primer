# The other workflow does not work on pushes to the master branch because the git
# diff comparison with the master is identical to the branch on which the workflow
# is running. In this workflow we  grep git log Merge pull requests and then
# compare the current branch to the last two merges. For merged pull requests, this
# finds Rmds that are not the same as those in most recent merge. For pushes which
# Preceptor makes from the local master to origin, this compare, this finds Rmds that
# are not the same as in the last two merges. To avoid testing the same Rmd twice,
# sort -u is used.
